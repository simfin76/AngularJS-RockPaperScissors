<p>Rock-paper-scissors was <a href="http://www.samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html">invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla</a>. Usually played by two people, where players simultaneously form one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The "rock" beats scissors, the "scissors" beat paper and the "paper" beats rock; if both players throw the same shape, the game is tied .</p>
